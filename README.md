This project is a 3rd-year collaborative project with a game designer, developed in Unity. 

The goal was to create a roguelike prototype within the Hack-n-Slash genre. Players battle swarms of enemies to gain experience and upgrade skills at a shop, with a unique restriction area system in place to manage enemy density.
